## Introduction to the Workflow

The basic idea behind the **Feature Branch Workflow** is that all
feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of
the `main` branch. Not only does this workflow make it easier to list
what features you've added by inspecting the log, it also means the
`main` branch never contains broken code! It also makes it easier for
you to stop working on a feature if you don't think it's going to work
out.

IMPORTANT
Before reading the rest of this appendix section, please refer to your
notes from the 3.1 Git Branching - Branches in a Nutshell\_ reading in
*Pro Git*.

## Rule of Thumb

Before you checkout a branch or pull changes from a remote repository,
you should always make sure that whatever branch you're in is fully
committed. You can always `git status` to check.

## Start Working on a Feature

You should use a new, separate branch for each new feature or bug you
work on. Give your branch a short name. In the command below, we chose
`short-feature-name`, but you should choose something that makes more
sense for the feature you intend to work on.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b short-feature-name
```

## Work on a Feature

While in your feature branch, update, add, commit, and push changes as
you make progress. Try to write [good log
messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) that are also short
and sweet. Most features involve multiple commits; let the log tell the
story of your feature development.

## Merge the Feature Branch into main

Once your feature works, it's time to merge the branch back into `main`.
We recommend that you follow the "Rule of Thumb" mentioned earlier, then
use the following commands directly inside your `cs1302-omega`
directory:

```
$ git checkout main
$ ,/prepare-merge.sh short-feature-name
$ git merge short-feature-name
$ git pull origin main
$ git push origin --all
```

NOTE
The `prepare-merge.sh` script appends a timestamp to your `README.rst`
in the `main` branch, then stages and commits that change. This ensures
that `main` and your feature branch have divergent histories, which
makes the merge look a little nicer in your log.
